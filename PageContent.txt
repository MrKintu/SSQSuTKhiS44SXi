____________________________________________________________________/nHONG KONG, March 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Akeso Inc. (9926.HK) announced that its innovative, self-developed anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, penpulimab, has been officially approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for the first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) in combination with chemotherapy.
Previously, penpulimab was approved for use as a third-line treatment for advanced NPC. With this new approval, penpulimab now provides comprehensive treatment coverage across all stages of NPC, offering patients a continuous immunotherapy option from first-line to third-line therapy.
This marks the fourth approved indication for penpulimab. In addition to the two NPC indications, penpulimab is also approved for first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) when combined with chemotherapy, as well as for monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) who have previously received at least two lines of systemic chemotherapy. Furthermore, a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for penpulimab in combination with anlotinib for first-line treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is currently under review.
Professor Hu Chaosu, one of the principal investigators of penpulimab at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, said: "In China, there remains a significant unmet clinical need for NPC. As the only IgG1 subtype anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody globally, penpulimab has demonstrated robust efficacy in clinical studies, enhancing the effectiveness of immunotherapy for NPC. The approval for first-line treatment marks a major milestone, as it provides a comprehensive treatment regimen for clinicians and patients, benefiting a large population of NPC patients in China, from first-line to third-line therapy."
Professor Chen Xiaozhong, one of the principal investigators of penpulimab at Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, said: "Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) is a highly prevalent malignancy in certain regions, and patients with recurrent or metastatic NPC typically face a poor prognosis. Penpulimab has demonstrated a significantly high response rate and prolonged survival benefits in both first-line treatment of NPC and in patients with metastatic NPC who have failed multiple lines of prior therapy. Additionally, it has shown a favorable safety profile, with a low incidence of immune-related adverse events. "
Dr. Xia Yu, Founder, Chairwoman, CEO, and President of Akeso, said: "We want to extend our sincere gratitude to all the researchers, clinical trial participants, and NPC patients who have contributed to this milestone. With its differentiated design, penpulimab has gained widespread recognition among clinicians and patients for its efficacy and safety in treating diseases like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Hodgkin lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal cancer. The approval for first-line treatment of advanced NPC will allow more patients in China to benefit from this new PD-1 monoclonal antibody, further improving survival outcomes."
"As key drugs like cadonilimab, ivonescimab, and penpulimab receive approval for a wide range of indications, Akeso's commitment to innovation and excellence in drug development—from discovery to clinical application—is clearly demonstrated. These advancements are not only improving patient outcomes but also reaffirming our dedication to transforming global healthcare. Moving forward, Akeso will continue to pioneer breakthrough therapies with the potential to set new standards of care, driving positive change in treatment paradigms and improving the lives of patients worldwide."

____________________________________________________________________/nBEIJING, March 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Since the publication of the first volume of Xi Jinping: The Governance of China in 2014, the book has garnered widespread recognition globally, becoming a key resource for political figures, scholars, and experts in many countries. It stands as the leader's work with the most published languages, the widest coverage, and the greatest global influence, opening a "window of thought" for understanding China in the new era.
To offer global audiences deeper insights into Xi Jinping: The Governance of China and the key concepts it contains, including perspectives on development, civilization, security, human rights, ecology, international order, and global governance, the Global Times is launching the "Decoding the Book of Xi Jinping: The Governance of China" series. Through themed columns such as "Scholars' Perspectives," "Translators' Voices," "Practitioners' Insights," and "Readers' Reflections," this series will feature perspectives from Chinese and international scholars, translators of the work, practitioners of its concepts, and overseas readers. It aims to share what they have seen and understood about China's philosophy, values, and wisdom through the book.
This is the first installment of the "Practitioners' Insights" column, which narrates how a grassroots legislative outreach office in Shanghai channels the voices of ordinary citizens to the nation's highest legislative body, acting as a vital mechanism for advancing whole-process people's democracy.
One day in late 2014 near Gubei Civic Center in Hongqiao subdistrict of downtown Shanghai, then 30-year-old Wu Xinhui met for the first time lady Wang (pseudonym). Wang, in her 90s, had multiple bruises on her body with eyes filled with helplessness and exhaustion. She told lawyer Wu that these injuries resulted from abuse by her daughter, who had taken her mobile phone and bank cards. Wang's request was simple: to change her guardianship and free herself from her daughter's "torment."
Wu is a director at the Shanghai Kangming Law Firm. On the day she met Wang a decade ago, she was unaware that, besides being a lawyer, she would assume another role as a legislative coordinator for the Hongqiao subdistrict legislative outreach office under the Legislative Affairs Commission of the National People's Congress (NPC).
Wu then spent several months taking legal means to change the guardianship for the elderly woman and helping her reclaim her property. The lawsuit was won, but Wu still felt a heavy burden in her heart, as she knew there might be many more elderly like Wang who needed legal protection.
In July 2015, when the legislative outreach office was established at Hongqiao, Wu was invited to become a legislative coordinator of this outreach office. About two months later, when the China's law on domestic violence was soliciting public opinions for an amendment, Wu was reminded of Wang's story and many similar cases she had encountered as a lawyer over the years. At the legislative opinion solicitation meetings, Wu sincerely proposed suggestions to include the elderly in the protection of the anti-domestic violence law.
When Wu knew that the later promulgated law on domestic violence includes the elderly in the protected category, she realized that even the weakest voices can be heard and illuminate the legislative process.
The whole-process people's democracy ensures the broadest and most genuine participation of the people. In Volume 4 of the book Xi Jinping: The Governance of China, Xi said, "If the people are only addressed in order to solicit votes and then are left out in the cold, if they must listen to grandiose election slogans but have no voice when the elections are over, or if they are wooed by candidates during election campaigns only to be cast aside afterwards, this is not true democracy."
In July this year, the Hongqiao subdistrict legislative outreach office will mark its 10th anniversary. Over the past decade, it has functioned like a "big pocket" for gathering public opinions, thanks to the efforts of Wu and other legislative coordinators who have walked the streets and alleys over years listening to local residents. 
In the last decade, they have solicited opinions for 103 draft laws, submitting a total of 3,771 suggestions to the NPC. These suggestions include ideas from community elders on resolving neighborhood disputes and expectations from office workers on labor rights protection. Each suggestion reflects people's longing for a better life. In the end, 337 suggestions have been adopted after research, and the voices of 46,586 people were collaborated, becoming a force for promoting the progress of the rule of law.
These numbers are dynamically recorded with red magnets on a wall in the Hongqiao legislative outreach office. After this year's national two sessions, the numbers will be further be updated. 
Yu Yiqing, a staff member at the Hongqiao legislative outreach office, told the Global Times that these numbers are more than just statistics. They reflect people's expectations for a better life, and show the extensive and effective nature of the whole-process people's democracy.
'Direct express' for democratic legislation 
The system of grassroots legislative outreach offices was introduced at the fourth plenary session of the 18th Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee in October 2014. In July 2015, the first four grassroots legislative outreach offices across the country were set up in Shanghai's Hongqiao, Jingdezhen in East China's Jiangxi Province, Xiangyang in Central China's Hubei Province, and Lintao in Northwest China's Gansu Province. 
Since then, over 90 percent of the legal drafts formulated or amended by the NPC and its standing committee has sought opinions from these grassroots legislative outreach offices, which serve as a "direct express" for democratic legislation in the new era, connecting the highest national legislative body with ordinary citizens, and becoming an important platform for developing the whole-process people's democracy.
In November 2019, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited the Gubei Civic Center while a consultation meeting on a draft law was underway. Xi talked to both the Chinese and foreign residents attending the meeting, and for the first time made the remark that "people's democracy is a type of whole-process democracy."
In the Volume 4 of the book Xi Jinping: The Governance of China, Xi also stressed that whole-process people's democracy in China is a complete system with supporting mechanism and procedures, and fully-fledged civil participation. "Democracy is not an ornament to be put on display, but an instrument for addressing the issues that concern the people. Whether a country is democratic depends on whether its people are truly the masters of the country."
The legislative outreach office at Hongqiao stands as one of the best illustrations of this remark. Over the years, local residents have contributed suggestions on China's major laws such as the Civil Code, the anti-domestic violence law, and Maritime Law. Through the small outreach office where Wu worked, ordinary citizens' opinions flowed into the "vast ocean" of national legislation.
Journey of 'co-governance' in Gubei community
At the end of 2024, something "new" happened in Hongqiao subdistrict's Gubei community. The bell, silent for over two decades, rang out once again in the revitalized Vanke Plaza at the community. Smart streetlights there illuminated the ground brightly, permeable paving bricks lay smooth and even, and children laughed and played on the wide circular running track.
However, this ordinary scene was "new" to local residents, as not long before, the plaza and its surroundings had looked entirely different: the pavement was pothole-ridden, with pedestrians occasionally tripping. Streetlights flickered intermittently, and compared to the vibrant bustle of surrounding skyscrapers, the area appeared dilapidated.
How to address these issues?
The Hongqiao subdistrict authority did not resort to making arbitrary decisions. Instead, it placed the key to solving problems in the hands of the people there. A "co-governance committee" was then formed, composed of local residents, merchants, property managers, and experts in legal and some other fields. 
Wu, as a "legal advisor" of the committee, was fully involved in this "co-governance" initiative. 
Wu and other members combed through each issue one by one and solved them one by one. There was a lively exchange of ideas, with repeated discussions and consultations. Eventually, they brought together opinions from all sides and found the "greatest common divisor" among the diverse demands -- to create a brand-new, landmark area that meets the needs of residents and tourists for leisure, shopping, sports, and etc.
This "co-governance committee," with no government participation, has incorporated democratic procedures into every aspect: full consultation first, then voting, and finally extensively soliciting opinions. Nowadays, the committee has evolved from its initial role as a "renovation task force" to a "standing governance body," frequently organizing community activities and turning the square into a beloved "living salon" for all residents there.
The transformation of Vanke Plaza from a shabby landmark to a space brimming with happiness has witnessed the steps of Hongqiao subdistrict in practicing whole-process people's democracy.
International resonance of democratic practices
As one of the first grassroots legislative outreach offices in China, the Hongqiao office has a unique "secret weapon" - a "one-body and two-wings" structure. The 420 legislative coordinators, like feelers, reach into every nook and cranny of the streets and alleys to collect the thoughts of the people; the 15 advisory units and the 15 expert talent pools provide strong backing with their professional support. Through this structure, the Hongqiao office conveys public opinion from the streets directly to the national legislative body.
The "no-threshold participation" mechanism also breaks geographical and identity barriers. Wu recalled that in the winter of 2022, when the renovation project of Huangjincheng block in Hongqiao subdistrict was seeking opinion, residents from different countries actively participated in contributing their wisdom.
Now, the grassroots legislative outreach office in Hongqiao subdistrict has become a window for international friends to further learn about Chinese democracy. In recent months, it received visitors from many countries including South Korea, Cambodia, Japan, Peru, and Spain. 
According to Yu, many foreign visitors were deeply attracted by the operational model of the Hongqiao office and, were particularly curious about the mechanism for Chinese citizens to directly participate in national legislation. 
They expressed admiration after learning about its operational model, Yu said. "They told me that it fully demonstrates the openness and democratic nature of Chinese legislation, and it also reflects China's institutional confidence in its democracy."
In Wu's view, over the years, an increasing number of people are willing to share their thoughts on legislation at the small office. At the same time, the legal and democratic consciousness of local residents is growing, who are becoming more adept at using the law to protect their rights and interests.
"Has the renovation of residential community been carried out according to legal procedures? Are the elevator installations compliant, and will they affect the building structure or the interests of other residents? Are the procedures of tree transplants in the neighborhood appropriate and complete? These details, which were not widely concerned about before, have now become the focus of attention for the residents. For the local government, this is both a challenge and a great opportunity to improve its governance capacity," Wu told the Global Times. 
This year, under integrated development of Yangtze River Delta, the Hongqiao office aims to expand its "legislative friendship circle" by collaborating with other grassroots legislative offices in this region. And the outreach office, as well as those who contribute their efforts in it, will always remain true to their original aspiration, just like the eight-character phrase on a wall of the Hongqiao office that reads, "Open the door for the legislation, consult people on the governance."

____________________________________________________________________/nLOS ANGELES, March 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The National Council for Incarcerated and Formerly Incarcerated Women and Girls regrets that Elizabeth Oyer is no longer the U.S. Pardon Attorney. We thank her for her exemplary service. In three years, Ms. Oyer achieved reforms people did not think possible. She reduced the mind-boggling 18,000 application backlog to 3,000 while new applications continued to pour in. She revamped the application forms to make them user-friendly. She made it possible for people to explain extenuating circumstances such as domestic abuse or drug addiction when discussing their transgressions. She traveled to prisons to meet with incarcerated people and had an open-door policy for advocates. Her record of service is extraordinary.

The Biden Administration largely ignored Ms. Oyer's efforts. Instead, it manipulated the commutation system by reducing sentences in broad categories rather than allowing people to go home and claiming that the Administration had issued more clemencies than any other. While any incarcerated person would welcome a shorter sentence, one woman received a reduction from 292 months to 280, or one year off a sentence of over 24 years. Her case was typical. Incarcerated people and their families deserve an honest pardon system that gives a second chance when deserved, not the statistical manipulation that the Biden Administration used to distort its actual record.

The future of clemency during the Trump Administration is uncertain.
The future of clemency during the Trump Administration is uncertain. A formerly incarcerated woman, Alice Marie Johnson, has been named "Pardon Czar." However, it's not transparent what influence that position holds or how it will be executed. If Alice Marie Johnson is genuinely committed to identifying individuals for clemency; those who are elderly, seriously ill, victims of domestic or sexual violence, or long-serving prisoners—and if Ms. Oyer and Ms. Johnson had been able to combine their expertise in partnership fully—President Trump could have restored clemency to its intended purpose: serving as the failsafe of justice.

President Trump's decision to fire Ms. Oyer because she wouldn't follow an order to give Mel Gibson his gun rights back without being vetted shows that the President only cares about benefitting himself and his friends. Our wait for a fair clemency system continues.Media Contact:The National Council[email protected]www.nationalcouncil.usSOURCE The National Council for Incarcerated and Formerly Incarcerated Women and Girls

____________________________________________________________________/nBALTIMORE, March 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, four survivors of childhood sexual abuse, represented by Andreozzi + Foote, filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against Jewish Community Services, Inc. (JCS) and the Mayor & City Council of Baltimore City. The lawsuit alleges gross negligence in placing and failing to protect foster children from severe and prolonged sexual abuse while under the defendants' care.
The complaint, filed under Maryland's Child Victims Act, details how plaintiffs E.M.C., E.W.C., P.G., and E.J. suffered years of sexual abuse while placed in the Spurrier Foster Home in Baltimore. Despite multiple reports of abuse dating back to the 1960s, the defendants failed to act, allowing the abuse to continue unchecked.
"Baltimore City and Jewish Community Services had a duty to protect these children, yet they turned a blind eye to blatant warning signs," said Attorney Nathaniel L. Foote of Andreozzi + Foote. "For decades, our clients have carried the weight of this betrayal. Today, they are taking a stand to demand accountability."
The lawsuit highlights systemic failures, including inadequate screening, supervision, and response to reports of abuse. The plaintiffs endured horrific abuse at the hands of known perpetrators, including foster family members and associated individuals. Despite multiple disclosures to officials, no action was taken to remove them from harm.
The plaintiffs are seeking damages for the profound and lasting impact of the abuse, including severe emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and financial burdens related to medical and psychological care.
"This case is about justice and ensuring no other child suffers in a system that failed to protect its most vulnerable," Foote added.

Why: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of Class A common stock of The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTD) between May 9, 2024 and February 12, 2025, both dates inclusive (the "Class Period"), of the important April 21, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.
So what: If you purchased Trade Desk Class A common stock during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.
What to do next: To join the Trade Desk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=35479 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [email protected] for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 21, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.
Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.
Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Trade Desk was experiencing significant, ongoing, self-inflicted execution challenges rolling out Kokai, a generative artificial intelligence ("AI") forecasting tool that enables users to more effectively deploy advertising spending, including transitioning clients to Kokai from Trade Desk's older platform Solimar; (2) such execution challenges meaningfully delayed the Kokai Rollout; (3) Trade Desk's inability to effectively execute the Kokai Rollout negatively impacted Trade Desk's business and operations, particularly revenue growth; and (4) as a result of the above, defendants' positive statements about Trade Desk's business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
To join the Trade Desk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=35479 or https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=28116 call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [email protected] for information on the class action.
No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.
